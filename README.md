## About Me

I am a Master of Arts Management student at CMU, currently in my final semester of the program. I earned my BA from the University of Richmond in Richmond, VA in Leadership Studies and Theatre Arts. Following that, I worked for a theater education nonprofit in Richmond, supporting our production team with my stage management, scenic painting, and sewing skills. I firmly believe arts learning and participation is essential for a culturally and civically engaged society. Post-graduation, I plan to work toward creating, providing, and/or improving those opportunities with an organization on the East Coast.

Outside of school, I enjoy cooking, baking, and appropriate wine pairings. I also spend lots of time at the park with Sadie, my 3-year-old beagle mix, so she can run out her energy and take a nap while I work.
