## About Me

I am a Master of Arts Management student at CMU, currently in my final semester of the program. I earned my BA from the University of Richmond in Richmond, VA in Leadership Studies and Theatre Arts. Following that, I worked for a theater education nonprofit in Richmond, supporting our production team with my stage management, scenic painting, and sewing skills. I firmly believe arts learning and participation is essential for a culturally and civically engaged society. Post-graduation, I plan to work toward creating, providing, and/or improving those opportunities with an organization on the East Coast.

Outside of school, I enjoy cooking, baking, and appropriate wine pairings. I also spend lots of time at the park with Sadie, my 3-year-old beagle mix, so she can run out her energy and take a nap while I work.

## What I Hope to Learn

Through this course, I am eager to learn how the use of different coding languages (html, README.md, JSON, etc.) factors into creating and sustaining online map projects. The first assignment was by itself very educational because coding is pretty foreign to me. I also want to get experience with mapping tools outside ArcGIS, since most arts organizations operate on slim budgets as it is and may be unable to afford that tool. If free online mapping tools do not have the data analytics capability of ArcGIS, what are the best analysis tools (or ways to combine them) to pair with them?

I also want to explore how ArcGIS and other mapping tools could be of use to arts educators, arts organizations, or cultural policy makers. While they are not life-sustaining like PPE for hospitals and consequences for them are not emergent as they are for doctors and nurses, health crises like the COVID-19 pandemic we are experiencing now have a distinct impact on their work and services. Is there a way GIS can help the arts and culture industry during this time, perhaps in helping them develop response strategies post-COVID-19?
